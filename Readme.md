- Nedb - lightweight database for data store
- Docker


## Application

This is an issue tracker like JIRA issue tracker. The app exposes a CRUD operation in create, reading, update, deleting issues. The application structure demonstrate on how to design application that are not coupled to each other. I approached it as a hexagonal architecture approach. I used factory, dependency injection on this project. Using also the power of Typescript to have the extra helpers when developing javascript application.

I have choosen Nedb for the data store as this is the lightweight version, I think it has the function to data store and persist data with minimal setup for this mini projects.
